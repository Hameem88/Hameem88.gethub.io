    The Facts:

    
</facts>

<listoffacts>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    
        <li> - The word cherry comes from the Turkish town of Cerasus.</li>
<li> - Cherries belong to the rose family.</li>
        <li> - Canada holds the record for baking the biggest cherry pie in the world. A pie weighing 39,683 pounds was baked in Oliver, British Columbia which broke the record that was earlier held by Traverse City.</li>
        <li> - The German word Kirsch – the cherry liqueur comes from the word karshu. This is the name given to the cherries that were first cultivated in Mesopotamia in 8 BC.</li>
        <li> - Once upon a time, serving ice cream on cherry pie in Kansas was prohibited.</li>
<li> - Traverse City, Michigan celebrates the annual National Cherry Festival since 1925. Called the National Cherry Festival since 1931, the event is now held for two days to celebrate cherries. Fun activities like pie eating contests, cherry pit spitting, and the Grand Royale Parade with the Cherry Queen are the major attractions of the festival. USA Today has ranked this as one of the top ten festivals.</li>
<li> - Every year the Tree-Mendus Fruit Farm hosts the International Cherry Pit Spit contest in Eau Claire, Michigan. The competition has gained immense popularity and the town is now known as the Cherry Pit Spitting Capital of the World.</li>
<li> - To really bring out the flavor of cherry, use 0.25 teaspoon of pure almond extract.</li>
<li> - Glacé cherries are processed for extra two weeks. This gives them a candy-like property and area ideally used in the traditional cake or even cake decorations and as an ingredient in cookies, breads and other baked specialties.</li>
<li> - A chemical reaction between cherries and alkalies such as baking powder causes a blue discoloration in a baked product. This can be prevented by using sour cream instead of milk in the recipe or by adding an acidic liquid.</li>
<li> - Cherries are best paired with herbs like sage, chives, and verbena; dairy products like sweet cream and ricotta cheese; and with meats like pork and beef especially when black pepper is added.</li>
